    During the summer of 2024, I had the privilege of interning at NVIDIA as a  Hardware ASIC Intern within the  CPU team. My primary 
focus was on automated code generation for UVM Flags.

    I have generated UVM flags for sub-fields in transactions of an existing  VIP and generated the control logic based on the  newly 
added sub-field flags. I have also perfomed  exhaustive verification of the functionality of the sub-field flags through Back-to-Back
testing. I am proud to report that these tests achieved a 100% success rate, demonstrating the reliability and accuracy of the addit-
ions. I have fully automated the UVM flag generation, control-logic generation and Back-to-Back verification generation using Python.

Thanks to this internship, I gained hands-on experience with code automation and verification. I have also  gained experience working
in an industry setting, collaborating with colleagues, working with tight deadlines, efficient communication and presentation skills.
