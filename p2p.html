     At Robotics Research Center @ IIITH, I contributed to the development of AutoDP, a platform designed to bridge the gap between 
autonomous vehicle research and deployment, both in simulation and real-world. This lets us seamlessy integrate multiple autonomous 
driving modules in a minute amout of time.
 Our team successfully established a real-time pipeline for point-to-point navigation and re-localization. By mapping our campus as 
a 3D point cloud and integrating tools and technologies such as ROS,  LOAM,  CAN,  OSM,  and CARLA for simulations, we've created a 
powerful ecosystem for testing and deploying autonomous vehicle algorithms.

     Working on this project has been an invaluable experience, allowing me to  gain lots of hands-on  experience with cutting-edge 
technologies and develop a deeper understanding of the complexities involved in real-world robotics research and development.
